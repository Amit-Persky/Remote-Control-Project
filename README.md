PROJECT REMOTE CONTROL- AMIT PERSKY
This project entails setting up a system that initiates with the installation of required applications, ensuring avoidance of repeated installations. It performs an anonymity check of the network connection, alerting if non-anonymous, and revealing the spoofed country name if anonymous. It also accepts user-specified scan targets. Furthermore, the system can establish a remote SSH connection to retrieve server details and execute commands such as Whois and open port scans. Finally, it saves the gathered data into local files and maintains a log for auditing data collection activities.

In the REMOTE CONTROL PROJECT.pdf, you can see how the script is working and behaving.

Of course, each user may need to make small adjustments for the script to work well for them.
